2D & 3D Fractal Image Compression Algorithms
======

This is a project that I pursued for my senior colloquium at Susquehanna University in 2010-2011. 


Abstract
--------
Use of Fractal Geometry in 2D/3D Image Compression
The storage capacity of hard drives has increased significantly in the past decade.  At about 10 cents per gigabyte of storage space, the cost per bit as of today is roughly about a hundred billionth of a dollar. This seemingly cheap cost of storage, however, does not rule out the need for image compression because the size of the images and videos has also increased considerably.  Of all image compression techniques, fractal image compression has a fairly high compression ratio. This compression technique makes use of fractals, i.e., self-similarity within the image to compress the image into fractal codes. A compressed fractal code file only consists of the header and the fewest affine transformations necessary to regenerate an approximation of the original image, as opposed to the color intensities of each pixel in the image. This colloquium explores the use of fractal geometry in a basic two-dimensional fractal image compression algorithm, which is implemented and also extended to compress three-dimensional images.
